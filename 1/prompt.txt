Write Python code that:
- Parses a list of strings
- Replace all substrings of numbers as a digit surrounded by the word on both sides, for example "one" should become "one1one"
- Find the first and last digit in each string
- Concatenate them together into a single value
- Add up all of the values together from all of the lines

Here is an example:
two1nine -> two2two1nine9nine -> 29
eightwothree -> eight8eighttwo2twothree3three -> 83
abcone2threexyz -> abcone1one2three3threexyz -> 13
xtwone3four -> xtwo2two3four4four -> 24
4nineeightseven2 -> 4nine9nineeight8eightseven7seven2 -> 42
zoneight234 -> zone1oneeight8eight234 -> 14
7pqrstsixteen -> 7qprstsix6sixteen -> 76
