There is a text file called "input.txt". Each line contains a character sequence that you must parse.

Write Python code that:
- Takes the first and last single digit number of each line and concatenates them together to form a single value
- Add up all of the values together from all of the lines
- The sequence can contain the numbers from 1 to 9 in word form. As these are also considered to be valid numbers, you should use a tokenizer or regex to map them into number form

For each line, you should replace the digits in string to numbers first, and then find the first and last numbers to concat them together.
