You are given a list of strings in the following format:
Game x: a semicolon-separated list of colors with numbers in front of each of them.
Your role is to figure out whether each subsection is within 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue. If all subsections of a game satisfy this condition, add x to the total number.

For example:
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

Only games 1, 2, and 5 would be possible, as game 3 has a subsection with 20 red, and game 4 has a subsection with 14 red. Thus, the sum of 1, 2 and 5 is 8 and the answer for this example.
