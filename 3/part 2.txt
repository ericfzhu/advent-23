You are given a grid of characters that contains characters.
Your job is to write Python code that for each "*", identify all numbers that are placed in the 3x3 grid surrounding it (diagonally adjacent cells are also considered as surrounding).
If there are exactly two numbers, multiply them together and add the result to a running total. If there are not exactly two numbers, then ignore the "*".
Periods are used to fill in empty space in the grid.
Numbers only appear horizontally. Ignore any numbers that appear vertically.

For example:

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

In the above grid: 
There are two gears. The first is in the top left; it has part numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio is 16345. The second gear is in the lower right; its gear ratio is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the gear ratios produces 467835.

Make sure that the example is correct before proceeding with input.txt. If the code tells you otherwise, then there is a bug in your code.
