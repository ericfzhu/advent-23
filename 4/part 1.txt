You are given a list of strings in the following format:
Card x: a space-separated list of numbers divided by "|".
For the first number on the right side that matches a number on the left, the card is worth 1 point.
Each match after that doubles the value of the card.
Two matches are worth 2 points, three matches are worth 4 points, four matches are worth 8 points, and so on.

Your role is to figure out the total value of all the cards.
For example:
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11

Card 1 has four winning numbers (48, 83, 86, and 17), so it is worth 8 points.
Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points.
Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points.
Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point.
Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
So, in this example, the pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.
