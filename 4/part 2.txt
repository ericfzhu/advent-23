You are given a list of strings in the following format:
Card x: a space-separated list of numbers divided by "|".
For y matching numbers between the left and right sides, you get one extra copy each of cards x+1 through x+y.
Copies of each card is scored like normal cards and have the same card number as the card they were won from.
If you win a copy of card 10 with 5 matching numbers, then you win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Your role is to figure out how many cards you will have in the end.
For example:
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11

Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win four copies each of cards 4 and 5.
Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win eight copies of card 5.
Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards.
Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards.

In this example, you eld up with 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 14 + 1 = 30 cards.
