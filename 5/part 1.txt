You are given a list of seeds, and several maps that serve as conversion between source and destination resources
The maps are listed in the order that they are applied.
Your job is for each map, convert the array of numbers from the source resource to the destination resource.
When you have an array of locations, return the lowest location.

Each map is presented in the following format:

source i to destination j map:
x y z

x is the start of the destination range
y is the start of the source range
z is the length of the range

source i between y to y + z - 1 are equal to destination j between x to x + z - 1.

Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number.


For example:
    seeds: 79 14 55 13

    seed-to-soil map:
    50 98 2
    52 50 48

    seed 79 converted to soil is 81
    seed 14 converted to soil is 14
    seed 55 converted to soil is 57
    seed 13 converted to soil is 13

    soil-to-fertilizer map:
    0 15 37
    37 52 2
    39 0 15

    soil 81 converted to fertilizer is 81
    soil 14 converted to fertilizer is 53
    soil 57 converted to fertilizer is 57
    soil 13 converted to fertilizer is 52

    fertilizer-to-water map:
    49 53 8
    0 11 42
    42 0 7
    57 7 4

    fertilizer 81 converted to water is 81
    fertilizer 53 converted to water is 49
    fertilizer 57 converted to water is 53
    fertilizer 52 converted to water is 41

    water-to-light map:
    88 18 7
    18 25 70

    water 81 converted to light is 74
    water 49 converted to light is 42
    water 53 converted to light is 46
    water 41 converted to light is 34

    light-to-temperature map:
    45 77 23
    81 45 19
    68 64 13

    light 74 converted to temperature is 78
    light 42 converted to temperature is 42
    light 46 converted to temperature is 82
    light 34 converted to temperature is 34

    temperature-to-humidity map:
    0 69 1
    1 0 69

    temperature 78 converted to humidity is 78
    temperature 42 converted to humidity is 43
    temperature 82 converted to humidity is 82
    temperature 34 converted to humidity is 35

    humidity-to-location map:
    60 56 37
    56 93 4

    humidity 78 converted to location is 82
    humidity 43 converted to location is 43
    humidity 82 converted to location is 86
    humidity 35 converted to location is 35

    The lowest location in this example is 35

Make sure that the example is correct before proceeding with input.txt. If the code tells you otherwise, then there is a bug in your code.

If you proceed with input.txt, say clearly that the answer from your code is equal to the actual answer. If you cannot, then you cannot proceed.
